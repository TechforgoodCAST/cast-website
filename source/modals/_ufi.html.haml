              %p Post-16 vocational learning is of huge social and economic importance, yet it is often overlooked in favour of formal and academic education.  The Ufi Charitable Trust is in a position to address this and we worked with them to find and support the most innovative uses of technology, and to create wide-spread positive change through vocational learning.
