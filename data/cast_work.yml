  - To transform the charity sector and enable it to put digital at the heart of its work, we need to support senior charity leaders and CEOs to understand the potential of digital.
  - Our Digital Fellowship is a carefully constructed learning programme that teaches its fellows the key aspects of the digital development, from paper prototyping to business modelling. We bring the leaders together to learn from industry experts as well as spending time with key organisations leading the field.
  - The pilot was funded by Comic Relief in 2016, and culminated in a design sprint with development teams from Founders & Coders for the Fellows to put what they'd learned into practice.

  - Working with Wales Co-operative Centre, Business in the Community Cymru and Wales Council for Voluntary Action, we're developing a digital service to support third sector organisations across Wales to access skills, mentoring and trustees to build their organisational capacity.
  - Having completed our Digital Fellowship, Derek Walker, CEO of Wales Co-op, secured funding from Big Lottery Wales to follow an agile user-led and test-driven process to identify how digital tools can be developed to provide this new support. We're leading that process to research, prototype and deliver this new digital service to support social organisations across Wales.
