  - "There is an unprecedented rise in food poverty in the UK. For example, in 2015 there was 42 times more food aid given out by the Trussell Trust than in 2009 – a massive 1.1 million emergency food parcels. But this is only a very small part of the picture. Overall, there is a massive lack of reliable data about food poverty in the UK."
  - "On the Fuse programme, we’re focusing on families living on the cusp of food poverty – those living in moderate food insecurity. We’ve developed a service that enables families to access high quality nutrition while simultaneously developing their financial resilience. This service offers support to those who need it most, as well as offering a unique opportunity to gather data needed to support wider social change."

  - Breast Cancer takes a huge physical and emotional toll. Whilst there is a range of support and treatment to address the physical aspects; the emotional impact is often overlooked.
  - The end of clinical treatment is only the start of women rebuilding their lives.
  - On the Fuse programme, we’re focusing on the needs of women moving out of treatment, finding out how we can support them as they adjust and adapt to life after breast cancer.

  - Over 1 million older people haven’t spoken to a friend, neighbor of family member for at least a month. Age UK believe that no one should have no one - it’s the UK’s largest charity dedicated to helping everyone make the most of later life.
  - Aging is not an illness, but it can be challenging and Age UK provide services and support at a national and local level to inspire, enable and support older people. Age UK joined Fuse to find ways to have more, meaningful conversations with older people across the UK to help them reach their goals.
  - On the Fuse programme, Age UK spoke to staff, volunteers and older people to understand how technology could have a transformative impact in supporting older people to reach their goals and enjoy later life. After going up & down the country visiting people’s homes,
  - a new tool was born to enable workers to have natural conversations with older people that also covered all the key topics to ensure they could help as much as possible.
  - Age UK are currently piloting the new tool in 4 locations across the UK. After the pilot, they hope to make changes based on feedback from users then roll out to more locations.
  - “[Fuse] is very fast-paced - which is great because we get so far so quickly, so even if we are going in the wrong direction, we will know sooner and could correct it quicker.” Asmaa Sehli, Digital Project Manager, Age UK

  - Every year tens of thousands of young people need help finding somewhere safe to sleep. They could be fleeing from abusive homes, unsafe accommodation or sleeping rough. Existing support services are stretched to the limit and simply cannot give everyone the support they need.
  - Centrepoint is already leading the way with its innovative programs like the award-winning Youth Homeless Databank project. On the Fuse programme we’re exploring new ways to support young people to prepare and engage with statutory services, as well as understanding how greater data collected about these young people in need can enable policy shifts.
