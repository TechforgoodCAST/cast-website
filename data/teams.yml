  - One in five people in the UK today are struggling to put food on the table and heat their homes. More than half a million people had to rely on food banks to feed themselves and their families in 2015.
  - Oxfam joined Fuse to find ways to address this challenge, while learning more about delivering social value through user-centred design and how technology might amplify their impact across all their programmes.
  - After speaking to users and service providers such as food banks, night shelters, children’s centres, social supermarkets and food voucher schemes, it was clear to see the gap in service provision for
  - those on the cusp of food poverty; unsure of where the next meal would come from but ‘getting by’, avoiding some foods, and sometimes even going hungry to enable their children to eat.
  - Seeing this gap and the small triggers that tipped people into food poverty, it became apparent that a new service should focus on financial resilience - not just food - in order to have the most impact.
  - On Fuse, the Oxfam team piloted a service that helps people to build an emergency fund for food through their usual shopping habits, while also enabling data collection around food poverty to help Oxfam
  - advocate and campaign for more systemic change. Feedback was great, with users quickly seeing the benefit of the service. One user commented, “It was really simple to do. You can just do your shopping and you’re saving money at the same time.”
  - Oxfam is currently looking at the best way to fund the future development of this service, identifying potential routes to support the next steps of the project.
  - <em>“The Fuse programme gave us a really deep understanding of user-centred design and agile development - delivering a service we can test across the UK to address food insecurity and enabling us to use this process elsewhere”</em> Seb Mayfield, Oxfam Project Lead.

  - Every year, nearly 60,000 people in the UK are diagnosed with breast cancer – the equivalent of one person every 10 minutes. Breast Cancer Care joined Fuse to look at new ways to support women diagnosed with breast cancer after intial treatment ends,
  - as studies have shown that it’s at this point that there’s a big drop in the emotional wellbeing as people come to turns with life after diagnosis.
  - Joining Fuse, Breast Cancer Care had a plan to develop a new service to connect women with others in their local area. After speaking to a broad spectrum of women,
  - it was clear that this wouldn’t provide them with the support needed after treatment ended. Through phone calls, workshops and the odd cup of coffee,
  - a new service was born: supporting women through quick tips and suggestions from the Breast Cancer Care community. It’s been really well received by users – with one of the Beta testers commenting “I feel like it could carry me through a bad day”.
  - Breast Cancer Care is now developing the service further, with the aim of producing an open Beta soon.
  - <em>“Fuse has equipped us with the skills to kick-start the delivery of digital solutions at Breast Cancer Care. Through the expertise and support of its programme leads, the project and the team have been accelerated.
  - Breast Cancer Care are very excited about the potential this project has to help women going through breast cancer”</em> Kristina Barrick, Innovation Manager, Breast Cancer Care.

  - Over 1 million older people haven’t spoken to a friend, neighbour or family member for at least a month. Age UK believes that no one should have no one - it’s the UK’s largest charity dedicated to helping everyone make the most of later life.
  - Aging is not an illness, but it can be challenging and Age UK provides services and support at a national and local level to inspire, enable and support older people. Age UK joined Fuse to find ways to have more, meaningful conversations with older people across the UK.
  - On the Fuse programme, Age UK spoke to staff, volunteers and older people to understand how technology could have a transformative impact in supporting older people to enjoy later life. After going up and down the country visiting people’s homes,
  - a new tool was developed to enable workers to have natural conversations with older people that covered key topics to ensure they could help as much as possible.
  - Age UK is currently piloting the new tool in four locations across the UK. After the pilot, the team plan to make changes based on feedback from users and then roll out to more locations.
  - <em>“[Fuse] is very fast-paced - which is great because we get so far so quickly, so even if we were going in the wrong direction, we will know sooner and could correct it quicker”</em> Asmaa Sehli, Digital Project Manager, Age UK.

  - 83,000 young people experience homelessness every year in the UK. Centrepoint supports more than 9,000 of them with housing, health and learning. They work closely with young people while also influencing policy to help young people get their lives back on track.
  - Centrepoint’s Youth Homelessness Databank project is focusing on how data and technology can be used to better understand and address youth homelessness. Centrepoint joined Fuse to accelerate the development of technology to enable them to deliver multi-channel information and guidance
  - to young people across the UK as part of the Youth Homelessness Databank project. Centrepoint discovered that one of the key challenges of any service is getting the information you need from service users quickly and unintrusively to understand how best to help.
  - Learning from their pilot phoneline service, they realised the need to use other channels to engage young people and those worried about them. After speaking to young people to understand how they like to communicate, Centrebot was developed.
  - Centrebot is a text-based messaging service that enables people to contact Centrepoint for advice and guidance through SMS and web; it quickly gathers information from people in a way that feels less intrusive than a person asking questions over the phone,
  - enabling Centrepoint to prioritise the most vulnerable and give them a call back quickly, and signpost people to other services when they know they aren’t the best organisation to help (such as those over 26).
  - Centrepoint is currently trialling Centrebot with users via SMS and is looking at the best next steps to scale the service.
  - <em>“As an organisation we have been trialling an agile and user-centric process to design over the past year. The [Fuse] accelerator programme has really made me question[s] and interrogate these concepts in greater depth, evaluate the way I’ve done things so far and
  - give me tools and principles useful in my current and future work”</em> Hafsah FitzGibbon, Partnerships & Participation Manager, Youth Homelessness Databank, Centrepoint.
